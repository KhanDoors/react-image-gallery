    info:
      "The syndics inspected the quality of dyed cloth. Rembrandt portrayed them looking up from their work, as though disturbed by our arrival. This artistic device was a clever way of enlivening the scene and thereby involving the viewer. This late work by Rembrandt not only attests to his endless creativity, but also to his undiminished popularity among the citizens of Amsterdam."

    name: "An Old Woman Reading, Probably the Prophetess Hannah",
    info:
      "Light comes in from behind the old woman: the vivid glow illuminates the book and her hand, so thickly painted that the wrinkles seem almost modelled in clay. Her face remains in shadow. The woman could be the biblical prophetess Hannah. According to the Gospel of Luke, she was an elderly widow who worshipped God night and day with fasting and prayer."

    img: "./img/pic5.jpg",
    name: "The Love Letter",
    info:
      "Vermeer chose an unusual vantage point for this painting. From a dim space in the foreground, a glimpse is afforded of another room with a domestic scene. An elegantly dressed woman looks up expectantly at a maidservant, who has just handed her a letter. The seascape on the wall behind them may well allude to the epistleâ€™s subject: during the 17th century, the sea was often compared to love, and the lover to a ship."

    name: "Children Teaching a Cat to Dance, Known as - The Dancing Lesson",
    info:
      "These children are up to mischief: they are teaching a cat to dance to the music of a shawm, a 17th-century wind instrument. While they are clearly enjoying them-selves, the cat screeches in protest, joined by a barking dog. The old man at the window angrily rebukes the children: should they not be learning something rather than giving dancing lessons to a cat?"
